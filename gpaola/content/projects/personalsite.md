## About the Project
I created this website to support my job search, and to practice some basic webpage development. This was my first time playing around with Go, and the Hugo framework in particular. It is a bit of a Frankenstein site at the moment, made up of a patchwork of files and bits of code. I will likely come back and organize the code in a future update.

## Technical Details

My personal site was created using the Hugo framework and Bulma CSS framework. It was deployed to Github Pages via an automated workflow. All illustrations were created by me in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
