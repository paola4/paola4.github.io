## About the Project
This is a medium fidelity prototype created for an application called "Report Bias" requested by a university. The application is intended to support reports of on-campus bias by students and staffs, and the handling of such reports by administrators.

## Technical Details

We used Google Slides to create our prototype. We chose Slides because of its collaborative functionality, and general accessibility. We found Slides had all the necessary features to create a medium fidelity prototype. The prototype was made 'functional' by embedding links to the various versions of the interface. The final prototype was exported as a pdf file, which could be easily shared with the client.
