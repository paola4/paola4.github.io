## About the Project
Neologinator is a generator of made-up words (i.e., pseudowords). Pseudowords are generated using n-gram markov models, which have been trained on a dataset of words represented as grapheme-phoneme alignments. That is, the words are generated based on the probability of one grapheme-phoneme pair at a time, given the previous n grapheme-phoneme pairs. For example, given an initial grapheme-phoneme pair of c_k, a bigram model (n = 2) will generate the next grapheme-phoneme pair based on the probability of it occurring after c_k in the training dataset. The words generated by the n-gram model are checked against a dictionary of English words, as well as a list of English proper nouns, to ensure the generated word is not a real word. As these look-ups are not exhaustive, it is possible that some real words may still be generated.

## Technical Details
This web application was created using Flask and basic CSS and HTML for the front-end. It is hosted on <a href="https://www.render.com">Render</a> using Docker.  


## Prototype
The front-end was designed on Figma before being implemented using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
