## About the Project
This is a simple wireframe of a landing page for a Plains Cree dictionary. The design was informed by feedback from a user evaluation, where participants were observed struggling to locate key pages for the dictionary (About, Bookmarks, Help). A contrasting red color was chosen to emphasize the header and available pages. Setting options that were previously only available under a drop-down menu ('SRO', 'Cree Syllabics') were represented as buttons adjacent to the search bar. These settings were frequently searched-for by participants during the user evaluation; having them closer to the actual search function is intended to support the overall usability of the dictionary.

## Technical Details

The wireframe was created in Figma.
