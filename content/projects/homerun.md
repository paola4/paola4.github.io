## Description
<hr/>

Home Run is a tile-based platform game inspired by an adventurous commute home. It was created in C using the free <a href="https://liballeg.org/">Allegro</a> game library and <a href="https://tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php">Mappy Tile Map Editor</a>. The game background design was chosen to present an upbeat, cheerful mood. Royalty-free music was chosen for the same purpose. The player must jump and run across platforms to get to their home. They earn a score only when they get to the end.

## About the program
<hr/>
The game begins with an introduction screen, and the player must indicate their intention to play by pressing a key on the keyboard.

The game then begins immediately, with the character sprite falling from the left part of the sky onto the first platform. The player must move the character with the arrow keys and press spacebar to jump onto the different platforms and avoid the water. Falling into the water will result in a ‘Game Over’ at which point the player can choose to play again.

If the player makes it all the way to the end, they will be greeted by a image of their home and upon jumping towards it will be met with a “Game Won!” menu. At this point there are no further levels and the player will only be permitted to replay, as well as to see their final score. <br/> 

Target system for this game is Windows 10 with Allegro library included.
