## Description
<hr/>

This simple game was created in C using the free <a href="https://liballeg.org/">Allegro</a> game library game library. In this game, a bird is moved using the arrow keys to avoid balloons moving in its direction. The objective of the game is to last as long as possible without getting hit by a balloon. Points are obtained for every second the bird does not get hit.

## About the program
<hr/>
Basic pixel sprites were created for the game. Royalty free music was also used. The game begins with an introduction menu that waits for the player to press any key to begin. When the bird hits a balloon, a “Game Over” screen will be displayed and the user will be given the option to play again or to quit altogether. The user also has a Help Menu (CTRL + H), and can Pause (P key) the game at any time. Music can be toggled on and off with CTRL + M.  <br/> <br/>
The target system for the game is Windows 10 with Allegro library.
